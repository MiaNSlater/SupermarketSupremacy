# SupermarketSupremacy
A simple console-based shopping application meant to mimic online grocery store websites such as Tescos, Sainsbury's and Asda.
Features a built-in basket that the user can check, add and remove from. It will also automatically clear its contents once the user "checks out" with their products.
Listed prices of the products in this application do not represent real-world prices. Or they can be seen as normal prices Pre-COVID, it's really up to you.
Will receive occasional updates to iron out any issues or bugs encountered while testing.
