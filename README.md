# SupermarketSupremacy
A simple console-based shopping application meant to mimic online grocery store websites such as Tescos, Sainsbury's and Asda.
Features a built-in basket that the user can check, add and remove from. It will also automatically clear its contents once the user "checks out" with their products.
Products have been put into a Dictionary in order to make locating and retrieving easier, and also because I wanted to experiment with Dictionaries.
Listed prices of the products in this application do not represent real-world prices. Or they can be seen as normal prices Pre-COVID, it's really up to you.
Will receive occasional updates to iron out any issues or bugs encountered while testing.
